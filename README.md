# Visual Novel Dev Kit for Unity
VNDK is a simple visual novel development that can be used as an architectural foundation layer for your Unity project.

## Design
The core design principle of the VNDK revolves around theater. Thus, every core component is inspired by elements you find in a theater.
Elements like stage, stage marks, and actors structure and organize the code base and game ingredients.

This approach is taken because a visual novel is similar to a play, with actors moving from one mark to another while reading lines. Therefore, I decided to inspire myself to something that exists in the real world instead of taking a more abstract approach.
